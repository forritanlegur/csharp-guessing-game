# csharp-guessing-game
A simple project I created for use in a bigger project. This game will randomly pick a word from a .txt file and have the user guess the word. For each letter that is guessed correctly the program will notify the user. 

The .txt file is called ROBOtext.txt
You can add more words if you wish. It should still work.
